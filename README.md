## You are supposed to choose a dataset (DS1) of your own choice. You may collect this data from any data source (such as an online, physical archive, survey or review papers, interviews, or workshops etc.). It must consist of nominal, ordinal, interval, or categorical features values. You are required to apply the following techniques:

1.	Apply possible data preprocessing techniques. 
2.	Apply any two unsupervised learning techniques (even if the data is labeled) along with clustering validation techniques to ensure the validity of clusters. 
3.	Apply either of the feature selection techniques. Choose the resultant feature set of any one technique to proceed for the further experiments.  
4.	Apply imbalance learning techniques (any of the two) on your dataset to balance tha data if it is imbalanced. 
5.	Apply any five supervised learning classifiers (either linear or non-linear). Try to use boosting algorithms (it will be a plus point).  
6.	Illustrate the results of various performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-sore, classification report, and confusion matrix) for each of the classifiers. 
7.	Take one more dataset (DS2) of your own choice, apply the automated features extraction technique (any two), and report on the accuracy of applying classification techniques on this DS2 after applying feature extraction. 
8.	Place your whole content (dataset, code files, results, images, etc.) on your GitHub profile. 
9.	Take one more dataset (DS3) for those whose dataset was a balanced dataset, they are mandatory to chose DS3 of your own choice and apply any two data balancing techniques along with reporting the performance results (of any one or two algorithms of your own choice) before and after balancing the dataset
